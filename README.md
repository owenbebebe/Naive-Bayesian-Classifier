<h1>Weather prediction - 1R Naive-Bayesian Classifier</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<br />
This project aims to evaluate the performance of a Naive Bayesian classifier designed to predict future weather based on past weather data. The classifier is developed using Object Oriented Programming principles and can work with nominal dataset. Initially, the focus is on completing  the classifier using a tree data structure. The accuracy of the classifier is then evaluated using two proposed methods, one involving selecting the highest probability outcome and the other predicting each outcome based on its given probability. The program is modified to include both methods, and the results are outputted for comparison. The project aims to provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of the classifier in predicting future weather and identify areas for improvement.
